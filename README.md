## Happiness-Ranking
Predicting Happiness Ranking for the countries around the globe.

## What is Happiness Index?
It's an indexation of happiness based on survey results that was first used in the 2012 World Happiness Report.
In the survey, the respondents were asked to rate their happiness on a scale of zero to 10. 
The happiness index is calculated by averaging the survey results of the respondents.

## Where did it originate and why?
So the definition of happiness index originates from the Bhutanese Gross National Happiness Index.
In 1972, Bhutan started prioritizing happiness over other factors, such as wealth, comfort and economic growth.
This inspired the Happiness Council to devise their own definition of the happiness index, which was coined in the 2012 World Happiness Report.

## Details of the Project
The Project is divided into 3 parts:
1) Building the machine learning model to predict the happiness rankings.
2) We build a Web application on Django to mount the prediction model.
3) We deploy the Django project on Heroku through github.

## Machine Learning Model
We start off with building a machine learning model using Simple Linear Regression and train that model using the Happiness Index Dataset.
For this project you will also see StandardScalar in action and why we have implemented it.

### Skills : Python, Django, Heroku, Linear Regression
